# Whoops.
Whoops. Broke the website. Gotta put something else up quickly.

# About Me
Hey! I'm Hans. My website is [hanskelson.com](hanskelson.com). I can't update it right now, because I don't have hugo installed on my laptop! Whoops.

I don't like publishing my email on the open internet. If you want to get in touch, either ping me on mastodon: [@sheepman@universeodon.com](https://universeodon.com/@sheepman) or open an issue on this repo and we'll figure it out.

# OpenShow
If you're looking at this page, you probably heard my lightning talk at DjangoCon. That was about [OpenShow](https://github.com/sheepman4267/OpenShow). Check it out and get in touch if you're interested. There should be a real release and a docker image... soon!
